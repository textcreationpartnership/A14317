            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Lorde <hi>Don Iean</hi> of <hi>Au≈øtrie</hi> thoughte it not good to enter into the goulfe, but the generall <hi>Biuier,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Iu≈øtinian Barbaric</hi> thought that be≈øte, earne≈øtly exhorting and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuading to go into <hi>Bisterlo.</hi> For by this meanes (≈øay they) they ≈øhoulde obteyne the victory: and they concluded that <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barico</hi> with eyght galeys ≈øhoulde goe to the entrie of the goulf, to a≈ø≈øay if he could trayne out the enemie: And whiles this was re≈øolued, the Generall <hi>Biuier</hi> was aduerti≈øed, that fiftie of the Turki≈øhe Galeys had lefte the armie, and were gone into <hi>Lenant.</hi> Whervpon the Lord <hi>Don Iean</hi> re≈øolued fully too enter the goulfe, and the ≈øixt of this moneth, being carried in <hi>Pregates,</hi> wente in per≈øone to
<pb facs="tcp:1923:3"/>take order and encourage all men to b√©e ready on the morow to the battayle.</p>
                  <p>On Sunday the ≈øeuenth of October, was all the Armie in a readyne≈ø≈øe, the generall b√©eing in the midde≈øt with fifty galeys, on the right hande the Lord <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barico,</hi> vpon the lefte the <hi>Ioerin,</hi> and the <hi>Dorian</hi> in the arreregard behauing him ≈øelfe verye valiantly. The ≈øixe greate≈øt Galeys rowed thr√©e on front, with .ij. lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Galeys after them. Thus marched they in order, helped ≈øomwhat forwarde with a ≈ømall breathe, more fauourable to the enemie, and in good tyme di≈øcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the other army, whiche came clu≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring lyke a wood, withoute any order. For they thought (as after was known) that ≈øo ≈øoone as they ≈øhoulde haue bene di≈øcryed, our armie would haue fled, and that they woulde be ready to ≈øpoyle and take ≈øome of our Galeys. But ≈øeing that the Chri≈øten armie made forwarde ≈øo boldly, they began to put them ≈øelues in aray, in fa≈øhion of an halfe Moone. Thus bothe the armies b√©eing approched with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Cannon ≈øhot, the ≈øyxe greate galeys
<pb facs="tcp:1923:3"/>did breake foorth, and pierced cleane tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the Turki≈øhe armie, whiche they put in greate di≈øaray with their artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: whiche acte may be accompted the onely and chiefe cau≈øe of the victorie. In the di≈øcharge of the great ≈øhot, the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes were more galled than the Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. The Catholyke Generall, and the <hi>Venetian</hi> general, hauing betwene them the chiefe <hi>Ba≈ø≈øa,</hi> boorded his Galey, and tooke it, and hauing cutte off the <hi>Ba≈ø≈øaes</hi> head, put it vpon a pyke, which <hi>Don Iean</hi> helde in his hande, as a troph√©e. <hi>Ochiali Ba≈ø≈øa</hi> with his galeys pre≈ø≈øed ≈øore the left ≈øyde: and all the bodye of the enemies charged the body of the chri≈øtian battail, when <hi>Dorian</hi> with the arriergard ayded the ≈øayd body: and on the other ≈øide <hi>Don Iean</hi> ≈øente to ≈øuccour the lefte wing, an other number of Galeys, where there were alreadye ≈øeauen or eyght <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>enetian</hi> galeys. In this maner foughte they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually from morning til night. But in the ende the Chry≈øtians obteyned the victorie. There were taken .Clxxx. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys of the enimies, xxv. were burned, xv. ≈øoonke, xviij. fled, whom the Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb facs="tcp:1923:4"/>pur≈øued. The great <hi>Ba≈ø≈øa</hi> of <hi>Argier Gitride</hi> of the great Turke was founde dead. The <hi>Ba≈ø≈øa Ochiali</hi> fled with a fewe galeys. <hi>Fortua Ba≈ø≈øa</hi> was not found dead nor aliue. And the <hi>Ba≈ø≈øa</hi> whiche came in ≈øteade of <hi>Prely,</hi> is he whome before I haue ≈øhewed to haue ben taken &amp; kylde. There are ≈ølayne .xx. thou≈øande Turks, v. thou≈øand <hi>Scarataui</hi> and .xiiij. thou≈øand Chri≈øtians pri≈øoners ≈øet at libertie. And they had taken into their armie to relieue them .xiiij. thou≈øande <hi>Spachi,</hi> whom they had leuied in <hi>Morea.</hi> The Chri≈øtians of <hi>Grece</hi> ≈øeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ≈ømal number of Turks left, &amp; the whole ouerthrow giuen to the Turki≈øhe armie, began to ry≈øe. And ≈øo ≈øoone as the Chri≈øtian armie turned to <hi>Corfu,</hi> they with the victorie of <hi>Seigneur Don Iean,</hi> b√©eing accompanyed with a <hi>Fregate,</hi> came to the generall, offring to follow what part ≈øoeuer ≈øhall plea≈øe him to go, ≈øaying, to haue very wel knowne that the <hi>
